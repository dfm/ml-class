=============================================

This assignment is implemented in Python with a few functions implemented as
C-extensions for speed.

Building
--------

Running "make" in the root directory should build the required C-extensions in
place and they will be accessible from the Python interpreter in that directory.
Alternatively, you can run

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

in the same directory and get the same results.

I also wrote a C-extension version of my EM algorithm but it depends on CLAPACK
(http://www.netlib.org/clapack/) and is only slightly faster.  CLAPACK is a bit
of a nightmare to link to (and the gains are only marginal) so it's not part of
the default build.  If you want to check it out, edit the config.py file to have
the path to your clapack.h file and then run "make clean; make" in the root
directory.  This may or may not work without more messing around.
